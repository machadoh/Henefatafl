##### 16 Point Stories
  - As a software engineer, I want the codebase to be well documented so that I can easily read, understand, and navigate the code.
  - As a software engineer, I want to run unit tests on computational methods so that I can verify they are working as expected, especially for edge cases.

##### 8 Point Stories
  - As a player, I want to easily differentiate the restricted squares so that I know where I can and can't move.
  - As a player, I want to only be allowed to make legal moves so that if I accidentally click a wrong square, it will not count.
  - As a player, I want to easily identify the squares where a piece can potentially move so that I don't find out after forming a strategy that a move isn't possible.

##### 4 Point Stories
  - As a player, I want to easily identify which of my pieces are moveable on my turn so that I spend less time thinking about it and my options are laid out in front of me.
  - As the attacking player, I want to be able to capture the King so that I can win the game.
  - As the defending player, I want to win if I maneuver the King to the corner squares so that I can leave the battleground victorious.
  - As a player, I want to know how many pieces both sides have left at all times so that I don't have to spend time counting and can strategize more effectively.


##### 2 Point Stories
  - As an attacking player, I want to capture a defending piece if I surround it on both sides so that I can more easily capture the King.
  - As a defending player, I want to capture an attacking piece if I surround it on both sides so that I can more easily help the king escape King.
  - As a player, I want my piece to survive even if I move between two opposing pieces so that I can form more complex strategies and play by the rules.
  - As a player, I want to know whose turn it is even if we save the game and come back later so that we waste no time remembering who went last and arguing over turns.

##### 1 Point Stories
  - As a player, I want the attackers to move first at the start of every game so that the rules of the game are followed.
