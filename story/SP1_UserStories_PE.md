##### 4 Point Stories
  - As programmers, we want to individually develop a prototype UI in order to familiarize ourselves with the libraries we plan on using so that we are able to more efficiently merge our code (i.e. the team is on the same page).
  - As a player, I want a main menu to decide whether I want to continue a previous game or start a new one.
  - As a player, I want to be able to see the board so that I can play the game.
  - As a player, I want to be able to tell the difference between my tiles and the opponent's tiles so that I can know what tiles are available to me.
  - As a player, I want the board to look visually appealing so that I can enjoy my gaming experience to the fullest.

  - As a player I want to save multiple games so that I can come back to different games I've started with different people.
  - As a programmer I want to implement Gradle so that I can streamline the build process for new versions of code.
